        <p class="text-gray-700">
            Grahmakh is a ritual performed separately at the bride's and groom's homes. During this ceremony, close family members formally invite the family deity, ancestors, and the Navagrahas (nine planets) to bless the upcoming wedding. The ritual marks the spiritual beginning of the wedding celebrations and symbolizes seeking divine protection, harmony, and prosperity for the couple's married life.

            <h4 class="font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3 text-lg">Seemant Poojan</h4>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
                The Seemant (boundary) Poojan (worship) marks the welcoming of the groom into the bride's family. It symbolises the removal of boundaries between the two families, affirming that the couple will henceforth regard each other's families as their own.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
                When the groom and accompanying family members arrive at the wedding venue, they are traditionally welcomed by the bride's mother. Historically, arrivals were often made by bullock cart or horseback after long, and often dusty, journeys. The custom of gently pouring water over the feet reflects a cleansing ritual. Sweets are then offered as a gesture of hospitality and refreshment. The groom subsequently seeks blessings from the bride's mother.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
                The bride is also presented with gifts by women from the groom's family.

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Maternal and paternal aunts and cousins from both families then greet one another, exchange coconuts, and formally welcome the bride and groom into their new extended families.

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Kanyadaan is a ritual rooted in historical tradition, in which the bride's parents symbolically entrust the care and happiness of their child to the groom. It reflects the parents' blessings and their trust in the new partnership being formed.

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
                The Lajahom is a ritual that honours the elements of nature—water, air, fire, earth, and space—acknowledging their power and the importance of approaching them with humility. Fire, in particular, symbolises purity and transformation. The sacred fire (havan) is regarded as a witness to the union.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                During the Lajahom, the couple offers grains into the fire, expressing their shared willingness to make sacrifices and to pray for a fulfilling life together. The ritual concludes with the couple tying turmeric threads around each other's wrists, symbolising mutual commitment and protection.

                A close male relative of the bride, such as a brother or cousin, playfully twists the groom's ear as a reminder of his promise to treat his partner with love, respect, and care throughout their life together.

                The bride's shela and the groom's uparna, the cloths worn over the shoulder, are tied together to symbolise unity between the two families and the bond being formed between the couple. Traditionally, a close female relative of the bride, such as a sister or cousin, ties the knot.

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                The Gaurihaar Pooja offers the bride a quiet moment of personal reflection in a small alcove, where she recites a brief prayer for the well-being of both her own family and the family she is about to join.

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
                The Muhurta is the auspicious time chosen for the wedding, during which prayers are chanted and the marriage is formally consecrated. During this period, the antarpaat, a decorated curtain, is held in place by elders of both families while the priest chants the Mangalashtaka (eight hymns). At the appointed Muhurta (moment), the curtain is lowered and the couple exchange garlands.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                An intimate group of well-wishers then shower the couple with coloured, uncooked rice, a traditional symbol of prosperity and fertility, to bless the union.

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
                During the Soon Mukh ceremony, the bride's mother presents a mirror to the groom's mother. Together with her son and his partner, the groom's mother looks into the mirror and gently runs a comb through her daughter-in-law's hair.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                This ritual symbolises her commitment to care for and support both her son and daughter-in-law with equal love and attention, and to welcome the bride as an integral member of the family.

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
                During the Grihapravesh, the newly married couple are welcomed into the groom's family home. The groom's mother washes the couple's feet with milk and water and performs an aarti (hymns) as a gesture of blessing.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                As the couple enter the home, the bride gently tips over a kalash (metal vase) filled with rice with her foot, symbolising abundance and prosperity. The bride then steps into the home with her right foot forward, accompanied by her partner, marking the beginning of their life together in the household.
